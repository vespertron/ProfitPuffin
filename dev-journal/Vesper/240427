## Stand Up

Yesterday - I finished creating the Trello board, https://trello.com/b/5bUnBJjr/swing-trader-bot. - defined the date range, granularity, coverage and format of the data I will need to retrieve for comparison and analysis.

Today - I wasn't planning on working but I spent a few hours looking for data sources to compare.

## Dev Notes:

## Accomplished:

## Upskilled:

Project Management / Estimating Scope: "Research and select a data source for historical stock prices" might have been more appropriate as a story instead of a task under "Collect Historical Price Data". Based on today's effort I think I need at least the week to collect data sources before I begin the comparisons.
